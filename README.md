# ♻️ Garbycle – Smart Waste Management Frontend

> “Because Every Waste Deserves a Second Chance!”

Garbycle is a smart waste management platform built with the goal of promoting responsible waste segregation, reducing landfill impact, and empowering women in the waste economy. This repository contains the **frontend prototype** of the platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The UI is multilingual (English and Tamil), responsive, and ready for future integrations such as Razorpay payments, AI-based waste sorting, and OpenStreetMap-based logistics tracking.

## 🚀 Project Description

The frontend of Garbycle offers:

- 🔤 **Language Toggle**: Switch between English and Tamil dynamically using a simple toggle button.
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Neatly structured layout with responsive design and clear visual feedback.
- 🗺 **OpenStreetMap Integration (Leaflet.js)**: Setup-ready for location-based tracking (pickup, delivery).
- ✅ **Accept/Reject Waste Requests**: Visual cues based on user action.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Cleanly adjusts across screen sizes and devices.


This prototype is intended for demonstration and UI testing only. Backend, payment gateway (Razorpay), and AI modules are part of the planned full-stack implementation.
